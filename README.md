# Nightfall_AI_Sample
Sample code from Nightfall game's AI

Nightfall was my graduation project which I colaborated over four months with two other developers, Austin Bunker and Sebastian Rodrigez (very cool guys).
The game was never concluded, each of the developers got busy and needed to move on, but the game was a nice prove of concept.

I was responsible for the AI of the game, and I am sharing some of my contributions to the game here.
Eventually I should share a link to download and play the game...
